jbrowse-hg19
============

HG19 In JBrowse readable json format

Takes quite a while to run JBrowse tool prepare-refseqs.pl on hg19, this is a pre-compiled version.

Intended to be used as a sub-module within other git repo's to avoid the need to hammer the size of the repo with 3GB of genomic data that is pretty static regardless.
