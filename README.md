jbrowse-hg19
============

[HG19](http://hgdownload-test.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/) In [JBrowse](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse) readable json format

Takes quite a while to run [JBrowse](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse) tool [prepare-refseqs.pl](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/blob/master/bin/prepare-refseqs.pl) on [hg19](http://hgdownload-test.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/), this is a pre-compiled version.

Intended to be used as a sub-module within other git repo's to avoid the need to hammer the size of the repo with 3GB of genomic data that is pretty static regardless.
